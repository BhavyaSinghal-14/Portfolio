# Portfolio
The project consists of a single HTML file:  index.html â€“ The main file of the portfolio. 
It contains all the content and structure of the website, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, and tables. The purpose of this project is to create my first personal portfolio webpage using only HTML. It serves to:  Introduce myself and showcase my basic details and demonstrate my understanding of HTML tags, links, images, and page structure.
